# Observational studies: setup, estimands and assumptions



---
## Observational studies

- We will not focus on randomized experiments since most of the data you will have to analyze in practice are actually based on observational studies.

--

- Recall that in observational studies, we do not control or know the assignment mechanism.

--

- In addition, the presence of measured and unmeasured confounders can create unbalance between the groups.

--

- To do causal inference, we often have to make some structural (often untestable) assumptions, e.g. on the treatment assignment, for identifying causal effects.

--

- Once we have those general assumptions, we also usually have to make model assumptions to do the actual estimation.


---
## Estimands

Once again, we will focus on the following estimands:

- The .hlight[average treatment effect (ATE)]:
.block[
.small[
$$
\tau = \mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)].
$$
]
]

--

- The .hlight[average treatment effect for the treated (ATT)]:
.block[
.small[
$$
\tau = \mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | W_i = 1].
$$
]
]

--

- The .hlight[average treatment effect for the control (ATC)]:
.block[
.small[
$$
\tau = \mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | W_i = 0].
$$
]
]

--

- For binary outcomes, .hlight[causal odds ratio (OR) or risk ratio (RR):]:
.block[
.small[
$$
\tau = \dfrac{\mathbb{Pr}[Y_i(1) = 1]/\mathbb{Pr}[Y_i(1) = 0]}{\mathbb{Pr}[Y_i(0) = 1]/\mathbb{Pr}[Y_i(0) = 0]}.
$$
]
]


---
## Estimands

- The relationship between ATE, ATT and ATC is given by
.block[
.small[
$$
\textrm{ATE} = \mathbb{Pr}[W_i = 1] \cdot \textrm{ATT} + \mathbb{Pr}[W_i = 0] \cdot \textrm{ATC}
$$
]
]

--

- In randomized experiments, ATT is equivalent to ATC because treatment and control groups are similar/comparable.

--

- ATE is then also equivalent to ATT (and ATC).

--

- In observational studies, ATE is usually different from ATT and ATC.

--

- The above relation does not hold for ratio estimands.


---
## Assumptions: unconfoundedness

We will need two major assumptions (in addition to SUTVA). 

--

Assumption 1: .hlight[Unconfoundedness]

.block[
.small[
$$
\{Y_i(0), Y_i(1)\} \perp W_i | X_i,
$$
]
]

  or using the equivalent form from last class,
.block[
.small[
$$
\mathbb{Pr}[W_i = 1 | X_i, Y_i(0), Y_i(1)] = \mathbb{Pr}[W_i = 1 | X_i]
$$
]
]

--

- Assumes that within subpopulations defined by values of observed covariates, the treatment assignment is random.

--

- Rules out unobserved confounders (assumption of “no unmeasured confounders"). 

--

- Randomized experiments satisfy unconfoundedness. 

--

- Untestable in most observational studies, but sensitivity can be checked.



---
## Implications of unconfoundedness

- Under unconfoundedness, it turns out that
.block[
.small[
$$
\mathbb{Pr}[Y(w) | X] = \mathbb{Pr}[Y^{\text{obs}} | X, W =w] \ \ \ \ w = 0,1.
$$
]
]

--

- That is, the observed distribution of $Y$ in treatment arm $W = w$ equals the distribution of the potential outcomes $Y(w)$.

--

   <div class="question">
Why does this matter or how does this help us?
</div>

--

- Well, the causal estimands are essentially expectations and probabilities.

--

- From probability theory, we know that we need to know the distribution of the potential outcomes $Y(w)$ to calculate the estimands.



---
## Implications of unconfoundedness

- Under unconfoundedness, we are able to therefore estimate the causal estimands from the observed data.
  
--

- Recall again that ATE is
.block[
.small[
$$
\textrm{ATE} = \mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)].
$$
]
]
  
--

- ATE can then be estimated from the observed data using
.block[
.small[
$$
\textrm{ATE} = \mathbb{E}_X\left(\mathbb{E}[Y^{\text{obs}} | X, W =1] - \mathbb{E}[Y^{\text{obs}} | X, W =0]\right).
$$
]
]

--

- Note that we need to average out over the distribution of $X$ since the original formula for ATE does not depend on any $X$.



---
## Assumptions: overlap

Assumption 2: .hlight[Overlap (or positivity)]

.block[
.small[
$$
0 < \mathbb{Pr}[W_i = 1 | X_i] < 1, \ \ \ \textrm{for all}\ \ \ i.
$$
]
]
  
--

- Notice that this is the probabilistic assignment from last class, that is,
.block[
.small[
$$
0 < \mathbb{Pr}[W_i = 1 | X_i, Y_i(0), Y_i(1)] < 1.
$$
]
]

--

- However, we can exclude $\{Y_i(0), Y_i(1)\}$ now because of the unconfoundedness assumption.

--

- .block[
.small[
$$
e(x) = \mathbb{Pr}[W_i = 1 | X_i = x]
$$
]
]

  is usually called the .hlight[propensity score].


---
## Implications of overlap

- Overlap implies that, in large samples, for all possible values of the covariates, there are both treated and control units.

--

- This is important within the potential outcomes (or counterfactual) framework both conceptually and operationally (variance inflation).

--

- Unlike unconfoundedness, overlap can be directly checked from the data often using the estimated propensity scores.

--

- Unconfoundedness and positivity jointly define the .hlight[strong ignorability] assumption.

# Regression-based estimation


---
## Estimation: regression-based

- With those assumptions, we can move on to estimation.

--

- Clearly, we need to adjust for any difference in the outcomes due to the differences in pre-treatment characteristics.

--

- Commonly via a regression model for the potential outcome on covariates

--

- However,
  1. validity of the analysis critically relies on the validity of the unconfoundedness assumption (which, remember is untestable); and
  2. usually, model parameters do not directly correspond to the causal estimand of interest.


---
## Estimation: regression-based

- For example, consider two regressions, one for each potential outcome. Write the mean functions as
.block[
.small[
$$\mathbb{E}[Y(1) | X=x] = \mu_1(x), \ \ \ \mathbb{E}[Y(0) | X=x] = \mu_0(x).$$
]
]

  notice that this need not be two completely separate regressions, but could be a regression with $W$ included as a predictor.

--

- Let $\hat{\mu}_w(X_i)$ denote the fitted potential outcome for $Y_i(w)$ based on the regression models.

--

- For ATE, the covariate-adjusted estimator is then 
.block[
.small[
$$\hat{\tau}_{\textrm{adj}} = \sum^N_{i=1} \dfrac{W_i (Y_i^{\text{obs}} - \hat{\mu}_0(X_i)) + (1-W_i) (\hat{\mu}_1(X_i) - Y_i^{\text{obs}}) }{N}$$
]
]
 
--
 
- Unlike randomized experiments, the estimator is .hlight[not consistent] if the linear model is misspecified.


---
## Estimation: regression-based

- Variance can be estimated using bootstrap.

--

- Note that regression itself does not take the lack of overlap into account.

--

- If the imbalance of the covariates between the two groups is large, the model-based results heavily relies on extrapolation in the non-overlap region, which is sensitive to the model specification assumption.

--

- .hlight[Take away]: Regression (or any model) here comes with a package. You need to know and acknowledge what
assumptions—explicit or implicit—come with that model.



---
## Strategies for mitigating model dependence

- To mitigate model dependence in the case of linear regression, there are two general strategies
  1. Attempt to fix the design - balance covariates
  2. Use more flexible model for analysis
  
--

- Best strategy is to actually use both jointly: first balance covariates in the design stage, then use flexible models in the analysis stage.

--

- However, in this class, we will not cover the kind of flexible models that would help, so we will focus on balancing the predictors/covariates instead.


---
## Strategies for mitigating model dependence

- .hlight[Covariate balance] (our focus)
  + Stratification
  + Matching
  + Propensity score methods
 
--
 
- .hlight[Flexible models] (we won't cover these)
  + Semiparametric models (e.g., power series)
  + Machine learning methods (e.g., tree-based methods (CART, random forest), boosting)
  + Bayesian non-and semi parametric models (e.g., Gaussian Processes, BART, Dirichlet Processes mixtures)

# Covariate balance



---
## Covariate balance

- Under strong ignorability, valid causal inference can be obtained by comparing the observed distributions of $Y$ under treatment and control if the covariates are "balanced".

--

- Thus, a good practice is always to first check balance. That is, how similar are the two groups?

--

- What metric to use? The most common one is the .hlight[absolute standardized difference (ASD)]:
.block[
.small[
$$\textrm{ASD}_1 = \dfrac{\left| \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^N X_iW_i}{N_1} - \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^N X_i(1-W_i)}{N_0}  \right|}{\sqrt{\dfrac{s^2_1}{N_1} + \dfrac{s^2_0}{N_0}}},$$
]
]

  where $s^2_w$ is the sample variance of the covariate in group $w$ for $w = 0,1$, $N_1 = \sum_{i=1}^N W_i$, and $N_0 = \sum_{i=1}^N (1-W_i)$.


---
## Covariate balance

- For a continuous covariate, $\textrm{ASD}_1$ is the standard two-sample t-statistic, and the threshold is based on a t- or z- test (e.g. 1.96).

--

- There is some debate on whether $N_1$ and $N_0$ should be in the denominator.

--

- In some disciplines, the ASD is defined as
.block[
.small[
$$\textrm{ASD}_2 = \dfrac{\left| \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^N X_iW_i}{N_1} - \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^N X_i(1-W_i)}{N_0}  \right|}{\sqrt{s^2_1 + s^2_0}}.$$
]
]

--

- The common threshold is 0.1.

--

- Limitation of ASD: only on the difference in means (1st moments), can not capture difference in higher order moments and interactions.



---
## Covariate balance

- More general, multivariate, balance metrics are available.

--

- R package for balance assessment: `cobalt`.

--

- `cobalt` generates customizable balance tables, plots (marginal distribution and Love plots) for covariates, with balance metrics.

--

- Besides checking marginal balance, it is always good to also check higher order terms and interactions.

--

- However, most times ASD is still the only balance metric checked in practice...


---
## The minimum wage analysis

- In 1992, New Jersey decided to raise it’s minimum wage from $4.25 an hour to $5.05 an hour. 

--

- What was the .hlight[causal effect] of this decision on employment in the fast food industry?

--

- To study this, economists from Princeton collected data from fast food restaurants along the New Jersey - Pennsylvania border, with the Pennsylvania restaurants acting as a control group for the New Jersey restaurants.

--

- They also collected data on several covariates for the restaurants. 

--

- The outcome is the employment rate after the minimum wage was raised in New Jersey.

--

- For more information, see the NY Times article [Supersize My Wage](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/magazine/supersize-my-wage.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0).


---
## The minimum wage analysis

- The data is in the file `MinimumWageData.csv` on Sakai.

  .small[
Variables    | Description
:------------- | :------------
NJ.PA | indicator for which state the restaurant is in (1 if NJ, 0 if PA)
EmploymentPre | measures employment for each restaurant before the minimum wage raise in NJ
EmploymentPost | measures employment for each restaurant after the minimum wage raise in NJ
WagePre | measures the hourly wage for each restaurant before the minimum wage raise
BurgerKing | indicator for Burger King
KFC | indicator for KFC
Roys | indicator for Roys
Wendys | indicator for Wendys
]


---
## The minimum wage analysis

```{r}
MinWage <- read.csv("data/MinimumWageData.csv",header=T,
                    colClasses=c("factor","numeric","numeric","numeric",
                                 "factor","factor","factor","factor"))
str(MinWage)
head(MinWage)
```


---
## The minimum wage analysis

```{r}
summary(MinWage[,c(2:4)])
summary(MinWage[,-c(2:4)])
```


---
## The minimum wage analysis

Let's examine covariate balance. First, summarize covariates by NJ and PA.
```{r}
summary(MinWage[MinWage$NJ.PA == 0, 3:8]) #first PA
summary(MinWage[MinWage$NJ.PA == 1, 3:8]) #now NJ
```


---
## The minimum wage analysis

Using the `bal.tab` function in the `cobalt` package, we have
```{r}
bal.tab(list(treat=MinWage$NJ.PA,covs=MinWage[,3:8],estimand="ATE"))
```

--

The distribution of prior employment is not well balanced across groups; other variables are pretty close, but we might be able to do better.

---
## The minimum wage analysis

Can also use `love.plot` instead.

```{r fig.height=3.5}
love.plot(list(treat=MinWage$NJ.PA,covs=MinWage[,3:8],estimand="ATE"),stars = "std")
```


---
## Balancing covariates: small number of covariates

- When the number of covariates is small, the adjustment can be achieved by exact matching or stratification.

--

- Exact matching: for each treated subject, get a control with the exact same value of the covariates (easier for categorical covariates).

--

- Exact matching ensures distributions of covariates in treatment and control groups are exactly the same, thus eliminating bias due to difference in $X$.

--

- Exact matching is usually unfeasible, even with low dimensional covariates.


---
## Stratification

- Suppose we have a single covariate $X$ with $k$ levels (e.g. race), where $X$ makes the assignment mechanism ignorable.

--

- Even better if we assume unconfoundness. Again, remember that unconfoundness means that
.block[
.small[
$$
\{Y_i(0), Y_i(1)\} \perp W_i | X_i.
$$
]
]

--

- Suppose we want to estimate ATE.

--

- Let
  + $n_k$ be the number of observations with $X_i = k$; and
  + $\bar{Y}_{k,w}$ be the sample average of all $Y_i$ values among observations in cell $X_i = k$ and $W_i = w$.

--

- Once again, recall that ATE is $\tau = \mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)]$.


---
## Stratification

- Then we have
.block[
.small[
$$
\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1)] = \sum_k \mathbb{E}[Y_i | X_i = k, W_i = 1] \cdot \mathbb{Pr}[X_i = k],
$$
]
]

--

  and
.block[
.small[
$$
\mathbb{E}[Y_i(0)] = \sum_k \mathbb{E}[Y_i | X_i = k, W_i = 0] \cdot \mathbb{Pr}[X_i = k].
$$
]
]

--

- We can then estimate $\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1)]$ using a consistent estimator $\sum_k \bar{Y}_{k,1} \dfrac{n_k}{N}$. We can use a similar estimand for $\mathbb{E}[Y_i(0)]$.

--

- Therefore, the ATE $\tau$ can be estimated by 
.block[
.small[
$$\hat{\tau} = \sum_k \left(\bar{Y}_{k,1} - \bar{Y}_{k,0} \right) \dfrac{n_k}{N}.$$
]
]


---
## Stratification

- What if $X$ is continuous?

--

- Stratification (subclassification): split $X$ into $k$ classes.

--

- Then, for class $k$, define $n_k$ and $\bar{Y}_{k,w}$ as before.

--

- An estimator of $\tau$ is then once again
.block[
.small[
$$\hat{\tau}^k = \sum_k \left(\bar{Y}_{k,1} - \bar{Y}_{k,0} \right) \dfrac{n_k}{N}.$$
]
]

--

- $\hat{\tau}^k$ is generally biased for $\tau$, however, stratification of over 5 blocks can remove 90% of the bias!


---
## Nearest-neighbor matching

- Regression estimators impute the missing potential outcomes using the estimated regression function.

--

- Matching estimators also impute the missing potential outcomes, but do so using only the outcomes of nearest neighbors of the opposite treatment group.

--

- They have often (but not exclusively) been applied in settings where
  + the interest is in the ATT; and
  + there is a large reservoir of potential controls. This allows matching each treated unit to one or more distinct controls (matching without replacement).
  
--

- More general settings: both treated and control units are (potentially) matched and matching is done with replacement.


---
## Matching (fixed number of matches)

- Let $\cal{M}_i$ be the set of the indices of $M$ closest matches of unit $i$ using a distance metric that depends on $X$.

--

- Let  
.block[
.small[
$$
\begin{split}
\hat{Y}_i(0) & = \sum_{i \in \cal{M}_i} \dfrac{Y_j}{M} \ \ \ \textrm{if} \ \ \ W_i = 1 \ \ \ \textrm{and} \ \ \ \hat{Y}_i(0) = Y_i \ \ \ \textrm{if} \ \ \ W_i = 0; \\
\hat{Y}_i(1) & = Y_i \ \ \ \textrm{if} \ \ \ W_i = 1 \ \ \ \textrm{and} \ \ \ \hat{Y}_i(1) = \sum_{i \in \cal{M}_i} \dfrac{Y_j}{M} \ \ \ \textrm{if} \ \ \ W_i = 0.
\end{split}
$$
]
]

--

- Then, the treatment effect within a pair is estimated as the difference in outcomes, and then we can average these within-pair differences.

--

- That is,
.block[
.small[
$$
\begin{split}
\hat{\tau}^{\textrm{ATE}} & = \sum_i \dfrac{\hat{Y}_i(1) - \hat{Y}_i(0) }{N}; \\
\hat{\tau}^{\textrm{ATT}} & = \sum_i \dfrac{\left(Y_i - \hat{Y}_i(0)\right)W_i }{N_i}. \\
\end{split}
$$
]
]


---
## Matching (fixed number of matches)

- Pros: Matching estimators that ensure good balance in covariates between groups are generally robust.

--

- Cons: With fixed number of matches and matching with replacement, the NN matching estimators are generally biased.

--

- Matching estimators are generally not efficient, estimators combining matching and regression adjustment are usually more efficient.

--

- There can be residual imbalance in matching.

--

- Perform bias correction via regression on the matched sample.


---
## Matching: Tuning

- Matching involves lots of tuning
  + distance metric
  + fixed or varying number of matches
  + for fixed $M$, number of matches
  + with or without replacement
  
--

- Tuning for matching is an art, with some theory and general guidelines available...


---
## Matching: Tuning

- Distance metric: Mahalanobis distance, propensity score, tree-based.

--

- Fixed $M$ or varying $M$? For varying $M$:
  + Matching with caliper: define a caliper (say 0.1) and all units within that caliper are matches
  + M increases with sample size.
  
--

- For fixed $M$, the choice of $M$ (number of matches per unit) has a bias-variance trade-off: 
  + smaller $M \Rightarrow$ smaller bias but larger variance
  + larger $M \Rightarrow$, larger bias but smaller variance.
  
--

- Also depends on the proportion of treatment versus control: when there is a much larger control group, we can use one-to-many matching.


---
## Matching: Tuning

- Matching with replacement:
  + Pros:
      1. computationally easier
    
      2. both controls and treated can be matched, but with high variances
    
      3. not order-dependent

  + Cons: some units (especially ones with extreme propensity scores) can be matched many times and thus heavily influence overall estimates.
 
--
 
- What about matching ties? What should we do about them?

--

- Matching is a vast topic and there are so many matching methods.

--

- Implementation in R: `Matchit`, `Matching`, and many more.


---
## Balancing covariates: large number of covariates

- What if we have a large number of covariates? 

--

- With just 20 binary covariates, there are $2^{20}$ or about a million covariate patterns!

--

- Direct matching or stratification is nearly impossible.

--

- Need dimensional reduction: propensity score.

--

- We will focus on .hlight[propensity score methods] in the next class and use them to analyze the minimum wage data.
